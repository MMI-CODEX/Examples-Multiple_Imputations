# Examples-Multiple_Imputations
Example code demonstrating how to incorporate measurement uncertainty into analyses using multiple imputations.


1.	Allometry – uses a linear model to explore the morphological relationship between total body length and rostrum to blowhole for Antarctic minke whales. Uses measurement data with uncertainty from [Bierlich et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3354/meps13814). Compares the linear model outputs using multiple imputations (two-stage) vs. full Bayesian approach (single-stage) for including uncertainty in analysis. 
2.	ANOVA and multiple comparison – comparing body condition across three blue whale populations. Uses measurement data with uncertainty from [Barlow et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/iob/obad039). Uses multiple imputations to include measurement uncertainty in analysis. 
3.	Linear model – explores how body condition increase in humpback whales over the Antarctic foraging season across different demographic units. Measurement data with uncertainty from [Bierlich et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1036860). Uses multiple imputations to include measurement uncertainty in analysis.

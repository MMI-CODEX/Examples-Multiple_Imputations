# Incorporating uncertainty into a linear model


# Example: Exploring how body condition, here measured as body area index (BAI), 
# increases over the foraging season for humpback whales along the Western
# Antarctic Peninsula across different reproductive classes.

# We will use a linear model and incorporate uncertainty associated BAI by using the 
# mean and sd of the posterior distribution for BAI for each individual.

# BAI ~ Reproductive Class * Seasonal Duration
